# Polymarket Finance & Politics Parquet Schemas

This document details the schemas for the 6 Parquet files. All files are located in `data/Polymarket/`.

## Timestamp Integrity Notes
Some Polymarket parquet files contain timestamp columns that are stored with
incorrect units. Values are effectively millisecond epoch timestamps but are
encoded with microsecond metadata, which makes raw reads appear as dates near
1970. The runtime loaders in `template/prelude_template.py` and
`eda/eda_starter_template.py` correct this by detecting pre-2020 maxima and
scaling the underlying integer values before enforcing a 2020+ constraint
(invalid placeholders are set to null/NaT).

If you read the parquet files directly (e.g., `pd.read_parquet()`), you will
see the corrupted timestamps. Always use the provided loaders for analysis.
