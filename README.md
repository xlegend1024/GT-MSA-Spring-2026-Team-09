# Stacking Sats: Improving Bitcoin Accumulation 

Building and improving data-driven Bitcoin accumulation strategies, with a focus on utilizing signal from predicion market data. 

See [stackingsats.org](https://www.stackingsats.org/) for more information.

## The Mission: Exploring Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation

As Bitcoin matures as an institutional asset, standard Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strong baseline, but there may be room for optimization. This project facilitates the design of **data-driven, long-only** accumulation strategies. The aim is to explore methods that maintain DCA’s systematic discipline while potentially **improving acquisition efficiency** within fixed budgets and time horizons.

### Latest Tournament
Trilemma Foundation hosts tournaments to find the most efficient accumulation models.

## Repository Overview

This repository provides a template and framework for:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Bitcoin price action and on-chain properties.
2.  **Feature Engineering** that integrates prediction market sentiment (Polymarket), macro indicators, and on-chain metrics.
3.  **Strategy Development** for daily purchase schedules (dynamic DCA).
4.  **Backtesting & Evaluation** against uniform DCA benchmarks.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/bitcoin-analytics-capstone-template
    cd bitcoin-analytics-capstone-template
    ```

2.  **Setup environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2. Data Acquisition

The `data/` directory contains historical BTC price data and specific Polymarket datasets (Politics, Finance, Crypto).

Data can be [downloaded manually from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gizJ_n-QCnE8qrFM-BU3J_ZpaR3HCjn7?usp=sharing) into the `data/` folder, or you can use the automated script:

```bash
python data/download_data.py
```

**Included Data:**
* **CoinMetrics BTC Data**: Daily OHLCV and network metrics.
  * **Bitcoin Price Source of Truth**: The `PriceUSD` column in the CoinMetrics data is the source of truth for BTC-USD prices. This is renamed to `PriceUSD_coinmetrics` in the codebase. This is the only column you hypothetically need to build a model (along with the datetime index, of course).
* **Polymarket Data**: High-fidelity parquet files containing trades, odds history, and market metadata.
  * **Timestamp note**: Some parquet timestamp columns are stored with incorrect
    units (millisecond values encoded as microseconds). Direct reads can show
    dates near 1970. Use the built-in loaders in `template/prelude_template.py`
    or `eda/eda_starter_template.py`, which detect and correct these values at
    runtime.

**External Data:**
External data is encouraged; students are responsible for ensuring that the data license permits all project participants to access and use (i.e., no proprietary data).

**System Requirements:**
Assume a modern laptop specification (think 16GB M4 Air).

## Model Development Guidelines

The framework includes a **Template Baseline** in `template/`. This serves as a starting point, currently implementing a simple 200-day Moving Average filter (accumulating more when price is below the MA).

### Exploration Path: Prediction Market Integration

A core opportunity lies in evolving this baseline into a market-aware strategy, perhaps by leveraging **Polymarket data**.

**Illustrative Examples:**
*   **Election Probabilities**: You might investigate if political event probabilities correlate with BTC volatility.
*   **Economic Indicators**: Consider checking if prediction markets for Fed rate cuts act as leading indicators.
*   **Retail Sentiment**: Specific "Polymarket Crypto" markets could potentially serve as proxies for retail sentiment or exuberance.

### Running Backtests

**Backtest Date Range:**
* **Range:** `2018-01-01` to `2025-12-31` (inclusive; daily frequency; no days should be missing)
* The backtest engine uses rolling 1-year windows starting from the start date, generating daily windows until the end date.

**Baseline Model:**
```bash
python -m template.backtest_template
```

**Reference Implementation (Example 1):**
```bash
python -m example_1.run_backtest
```

## Key Performance Indicators

When evaluating strategies, you might consider the following metrics (which are calculated by the automated backtest engine):

1.  **Win Rate**: Useful for understanding consistency—how often does the strategy outperform a standard DCA over 1-year windows?
2.  **SPD (Sats Per Dollar)**: A measure of raw efficiency—are you acquiring more bitcoin for the same capital?
3.  **Model Score**: A composite metric that balances performance (Win Rate) with risk-adjusted returns, offering a holistic view of strategy health.
